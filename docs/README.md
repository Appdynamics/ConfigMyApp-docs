# Introduction

Monitoring as a service (MaaS) is one of many cloud delivery models under anything as a service (XaaS). It is a framework that facilitates the deployment of monitoring functionalities for various other services and applications within the cloud, usually via a CI/CD pipeline. ConfigMyApp was built to enable AppDynamics customers actualise thier MaaS objectives.

ConfigMyApp design is based on the DevOps configuration-as-code paradigm. It is primarily built to enhance medium and large scale application configuration and dashboarding with a specific objective in mind - the ability to plug it into customers' Continous Integration and Deployment pipelines - such as Jenkins, Harness, TeamCity, GitLab, Bamboo, etc. 

# How it works

ConfigMyApp currently supports the following configurations (as-code): 
 
1) Business transactions detection rules - for  POCOs, POJOs, Servlets and ASPs transactions 
2) Server Viz Health Rules   
3) Application Health Rules  
4) DB Monitoring 
6) Custom dashboard branding 
5) and finally, ConfigMyApp dynamically pulls all the configurations into a dynamic dashboard.
